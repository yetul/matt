## Abstract
If a strong t-stat on technical indicators doesnâ€™t nearly beat the market, what would a strong test statistic on macroeconomic variables turn? This is answered in this paper using data from Goyal and Welch. Other papers by Lutey (2019, wp) show that strong test statistics from technical indicators have profit but lag the market returns.
