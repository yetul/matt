## Abstract
This paper provides an alternative view of the popular CAN SLIM investing strategy
by modifying and weighting the criterion. The modified criterion is used to build a
portfolio in each of three overlapping time frames. The results of the study are
compared to a Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark over the same time frame and
is evaluated on a risk adjusted basis. The study finds that the system outperforms the
market on a risk adjusted basis in all three time frames and holds a high R Squared for
each timeframe. The null hypothesis for the majority of this paper is to test whether the
mean returns of the strategy are significantly different from zero on a monthly basis.
This is tested over three overlapping timeframes of five years, ten years and sixteen
years respectively. A further hypothesis is tested for the 2008-2009 timeframe and is
whether the mean excess returns of the strategy are significantly different from zero
when compared to the Dow Jones benchmark. This paper finds that the null hypothesis
is rejected over all time frames with strong evidence. An exception is the 16-year time
frame where the null is rejected with weak evidence.[[PDF]](/files/lutey2.pdf)
