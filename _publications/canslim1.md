## Abstract
Investorâ€™s Business Daily has advocated the CAN SLIM investment strategy since the 1980s.
Unlike traditional long term, buy and hold portfolio strategies, CAN SLIM advocates an active
management style. This paper examines the use of a simplified version to test for effective and
profitable investment possibilities. The results indicate that an average investor with little or no
analytical capabilities can outperform a buy and hold strategy in the S&P 500 Index. The
simplified system outperformed the S&P 500 Index by .82% per month for the period 2001
through 2012. [[PDF]](/files/lutey1.pdf)
