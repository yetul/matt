## Abstract

This paper shows a CAN SLIM method tested live over 2014-2017 using free available stock screeners and Google finance portfolios. The strategy outperforms the market by 20% (SP500), 9% (Nasdaq), 17% (Dow Jones). The portfolio holds positions that pass a screen using the methodology of O'Neill (1988) and can be implemented using tools available for free online. This shows that the CAN SLIM system when combined with technical analysis can beat the market when tested in a paper trading environment.
