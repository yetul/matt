## Abstract
Previous studies on the CAN SLIM system show positive profit in excess of the market on the S&P 500 (Lutey et al. 2013), Dow Jones (Lutey et al. 2018), and Nasdaq 100 (Lutey et al. 2014). Previous studies don’t include the use of technical indicators which is called for in the system outlined by O’Neil (1988). This paper seeks to add technical indicators along with a current earnings heavy strategy for selecting stocks based on the interpretation of O’Neil (1988). The preliminary results show two ranking systems which outperform the market from 1999-2015, 2010-2015, 1999-2015, and 1999-2017.
