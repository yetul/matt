## Abstract
Forecasting risk premium with technical indicators shows that it is difficult to beat the market with a strong positive test statistic (Lutey, 2019 wp). Macro fundamentals show similar results (Lutey, 2019 wp). This paper uses a genetic algorithm of technical indicators and combines an investment strategy that switches between indicators from 1950-2016 based on their previous accuracy. The purpose is to mimic how an investor may trade the market using technical analysis and past information. The result shows that a $1 investment in the S&P 500 in 1950 would yield $200 in 2016. This is compared to $127 buy and hold.
