## Abstract
The literature shows that CAN SLIM portfolios generate excess returns when benchmarked on the S&P 500 (AAII(2007), Lutey, Crum, Rayome (2013,2014)). The purpose of the study is to take the mnemonic system and derive it on current earnings estimates, and buying near new highs, which are motivated by literature (Vulonteenaho (2002), Jegadeesh Titman (1993)). Using Standard and Poorâ€™s Compustat, this model shows returns of 1344% and 2069%( over 18 years for modified and full systems respectively). This study also tests the CAN SLIM method in CAPM and Fama and French 3 Factors. Showing high excess return (117%, 78% for full and modified portfolios respectively), beta (38%, 40% for full and modified respectively), and required return (45% monthly, 543% annualized, 41% monthly, 491% annualized, for full and modified portfolios respectively). Also, monthly Sharpe ratios show (0.08, and .12 for full and modified portfolios). In general, it shows that the CAN SLIM investment strategy, shows promise in a reduced form but also carries a high cost of equity.
