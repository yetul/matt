## Abstract
I test several guru stock selection strategies such as Warren Buffet and William O'Neil, and benchmark using the capital asset pricing model against the S&P 500 returns and CAN SLIM stock selection strategy. The results show high risk premium required for the CAN SLIM method, although it provides superior returns.
