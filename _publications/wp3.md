## Abstract

I test the Ichimoku cloud indicator on several foreign exchange markets, benchmarking returns on a buy-and-hold strategy. I find that the Ichimoku cloud indicator tends to alter the distribution of returns when it is conditioned on several buy signals outlined by David Linton's book (U.K. print) Ichimoku Cloud. The strategy is profitable but not always in excess of a buy-and-hold. Contrarian strategies with this indicator show some promise for excess returns.
