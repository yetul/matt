## Abstract

This paper studies whether or not market participants can gain information from adding a technical indicator such as the moving average, or in this case the Ichimoku Cloud when determining market position. This study considers both long and short strategies benchmarked for the time period January 1 1990 â€“ February 1 2016. S&P 500. Transaction costs are considered as 0.005 and the risk free rate of return is observed on most studies for days out of the market. This paper also tests the major cloud signals outlined in Linton 2010 and includes them in a equity premium framework with a primitive learning model and stepwise regression. The results show statistically significant excess returns when returns are generated from the cloud signals and moving averages. These may be included in a Fama and French portfolio. The cloud signals also are tested over a random sample of 30 individual stocks from the Nasdaq 100. The results are conflicting and show when the signals are taken individually they are often profitable but they do not beat the market on their own or with transaction costs. When combined they do show profitable returns when they are allowed to shift between which combination are most accurate over one-two weeks of trading. The step-regression may be a useful tool when combining indicators that are found to be significant in an equity premium setting and the main theme is that the cloud signals may be better combined than used individually, however some of the signals show positive excess return on their own.
