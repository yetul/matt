## Abstract
We backtest a CAN SLIM ranking system on a portfolio of stocks. We apply the model to three benchmarks (Nasdaq 100, SP 1500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average) over 1999-2017, 2010-2017, and 2015-2017. The system shows the excess return on all benchmarks over all time frames and a lower maximum drawdown in some cases. The 2015-2017 is an out of sample period and the Nasdaq 100 and SP 1500 are provided for robustness as the model is created in 2015 for the Dow Jones Industrial average. McLean and Pontiff (2016) the findings point to mispricing as the source of predictability. Post-publication, stocks in characteristic portfolios experience higher volume, variance, and short interest, and higher correlations with portfolios that are based on published characteristics.
