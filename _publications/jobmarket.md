## Abstract

I test modern applications of computer vision and machine learning to detect visual chart patterns as outlined in Lo, Mamysky, and Wang (2000). Specifically convolutional neural networks and support vector machines along with template matching algorithms are tested to detect the accuracy and ability to detect classic technical patterns when compared with the traditional method of identifying extrema from smoothing kernels. Preliminary results show an ability to detect double bottoms in the presence of noise.
