## Abstract
The CAN SLIM investment strategy was developed by William J. O’Neil and has been popularized by
Investor’s Business Daily. This trading strategy involves selecting stocks based upon seven criteria, and
requires active portfolio management. This paper presents and tests a simplified version of the CAN
SLIM strategy, which could relatively easily be used by individual investors using stock screeners. The
simplified trading strategy outperformed the NASDAQ 100 Index by .94% per month for the period 2010
through 2013 and achieved a greater reward per unit of risk when compared to the NASDAQ 100.[[PDF]](/files/opbm2.pdf)
