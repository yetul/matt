excerpt: 'This paper presents and tests a simplified version of the CAN
SLIM strategy, which could relatively easily be used by individual investors using stock screeners. The
simplified trading strategy outperformed the NASDAQ 100 Index by .94% per month for the period 2010
through 2013 and achieved a greater reward per unit of risk when compared to the NASDAQ 100'
