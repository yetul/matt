## Abstract
Excess returns and statistical significance don’t really go hand in hand. Regressions of risk premium forecasting show that indicators with strong test statistics don’t outperform their benchmark albeit having positive profit. Strong test statistics versus non positive test statistics only provide additional return of $2 from a $1 investment on the S&P 500 over 1990-present. ($100 in 1990 turns in to $600 in 2017, compared with $100 in 1950 turns in to $800 in 2017) for a positive test statistic. The market return takes $100 and turns it in to $1,270 in 2017 over the same time frame.
