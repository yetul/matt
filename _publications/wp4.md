## Abstract
Given the results from a Survival Analysis of Technical Indicators, I test the Ichimoku cloud indicators ability to forecast equity risk premium in the presence of traditional factors such as size and market-to-book. Short-term signals and long-term contrarian strategies show positive test statistics over long horizons.
