## Abstract
I test the forecasting ability of the Ichimoku cloud indicator (outlined in Linton(2010,print)) on the U.S. aggregate stock market. Contrarian strategies for long term parameters show strong test statistics. Short term parameters also show promise. The Ichimoku cloud may be an effective tool for practitioners and academics for testing equity risk premium.
