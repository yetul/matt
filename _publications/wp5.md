## Abstract
I reveiw the robust literature on pay gap and design a study to test whether outsider CEOs earn unfair excess pay when compared with their industry and size matched inside counterparts. The purpose is to test whether outside CEO pay is measurable with the skill set they bring to the table from outside appointments.
