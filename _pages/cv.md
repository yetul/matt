* For fun I enjoy playing volleyball, ultimate,  working out at the gym, and running.
* I've been spending my free time putting different operating systems on both Mac and Windows PCs. I've been running operating systems inside a virtual environment (Windows inside Mac, and Linux inside Windows), removing an operating system (Windows) and adding a new one (Linux), booting a computer into two different operating systems (Windows, and Linux), and lastly booting an operating system from an external drive (Windows on Mac). Just for a project.
