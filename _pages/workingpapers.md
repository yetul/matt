* This shows the non-linear price patterns most commonly used by technical trade that have been detected using a sample stock. Each pattern is defined as a set of rules relating to price minima, maxima, and their relative position to each other. For example, a head and shoulder pattern consists of 5 extrema. E1 must be a maximum; E3 > E1; E3 > E5; E1 and E5 must be within 1.5% of their average; E2 and E4 must be within 1.5% of their average. The other pattern are detailed by Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (LMW, 2000). The detection of each patterns requires 35 daily prices. When selecting a pattern, only periods during which the specific pattern was detected can be displayed using the second drop-down menu.<br>

* Technical traders often search for these patterns as mean to extract information on future stock prices. This shows the sample stock price and its smoothed price (used to approximate a technician's view) over a 35 day period. Vertical lines  outline the extrema used in defining the pattern. Each pattern is defined as a set of rules relating to price minima, maxima, and their relative position to each other.<br>

* This research discusses nonlinear patterns common in technical trading circles (i.e. Head and Shoulders) which are identified by extrema and are related to the image above. The full pattern definitions are outlined in Lo, Mamysky, and Wang (LMW, 2000). The question addressed in this is twofold, first, can nonrandom patterns be identified objectively using local polynomial regression and bandwidth selection, and second, can the patterns be identified using image processing. <br>

* This leads in to a second part which discusses conditional returns of the patterns and predictability using digital image processing. More on this to come.

## Working Papers

* The first paper titled “Reliability of Pattern Recognition in Recognizing Stock Price Patterns” discusses detecting nonrandom patterns in financial data using kernel smoothing and cross-validated bandwidth selection in rolling windows, using a new method called maximum price deviation. The new method sets a maximum deviation in the bandwidth minimization problem, which would otherwise go to zero. The contribution is that the patterns can be identified objectively rather than through professional recommendation (e.g. visually selecting bandwidth). This research paper first matches the patterns to LMW (2000) and then identifies the patterns in rolling windows over a full sample of 1971-2009 on Centex Security (CTX). The completed paper will include all cross-sectional stocks in CRSP using dividend and split adjusted log prices. This feeds in to the second paper which discusses whether nonrandom technical patterns are evident in financial time series. <br>
* The second essay titled “Stock Price Pattern Recognition and Conditional Returns” focuses on supervised machine learning and computer vision to obtain statistics on the patterns, forecasting, and profitability. The contribution is that the patterns may be detected in stock chart images using rolling windows and allow for forecasting, pattern statistics, forecasting, and pattern detection without needing raw data.<br>
* The contribution may lead to market efficiency and program trading, as well as potential future research aggregating the bias of pattern output and professional recommendation. Further works may include more pattern definitions.<br>
