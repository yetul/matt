* My dissertation and job market research ask whether computer vision and machine learning can detect nonrandom patterns in financial data. Standard time serious methods would not otherwise detect these patterns which are outlined in a paper by Lo, Mamysky, Wang (LMW 2000). The contribution benefits both academia and industry through market efficiency research and program trading. This research leads to two essays. The first paper titled “Reliability of Pattern Recognition in Recognizing Stock Price Patterns” discusses detecting nonrandom patterns in financial data using kernel smoothing and cross-validated bandwidth selection in rolling windows, using a new method called maximum price deviation. The new method sets a maximum deviation in the bandwidth minimization problem, which would otherwise go to zero. The contribution is that the patterns can be identified objectively rather than through professional recommendation (e.g. visually selecting bandwidth). This research paper first matches the patterns to LMW (2000) and then identifies the patterns in rolling windows over a full sample of 1971-2009 on Centex Security (CTX). The completed paper will include all cross-sectional stocks in CRSP using dividend and split adjusted log prices. This feeds in to the second paper which discusses whether nonrandom technical patterns are evident in financial time series. This essay titled “Stock Price Pattern Recognition and Conditional Returns” focuses on supervised machine learning and computer vision to obtain statistics on the patterns, forecasting, and profitability. The contribution is that the patterns may be detected in stock chart images using rolling windows and allow for forecasting, pattern statistics, forecasting, and pattern detection without needing raw data. The contribution may lead to market efficiency and program trading, as well as potential future research aggregating the bias of pattern output and professional recommendation. Further works may include more pattern definitions.
