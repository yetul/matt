Took a friend to the Barkkus Parade on Sunday in the French Quarter. Posting a view pics that were taken on her Nikon camera. Mostly the crowd and atmosphere, no dog pics!

A quick reminder: The traditional Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold were not chosen arbitrarily. Rex, the King of Carnival, selected this scheme in 1892, declaring purple for justice, green for faith and gold for power.
