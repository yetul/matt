Took a visit on Tuesday to the Audobon Zoo in New Orleans. I went with a friend from LSU. We got free tickets thanks to a good connection!

It was a nice break from studying and school and a good way to get in gear for the spring semester. We saw a lot of animals including many more that aren't pictured below. I would recommend going to the zoo and seeing the giant elephants or the Komodo Dragon!
