Decided last minute, Sunday to take a road trip to Atlanta.
===

Country inn and Suites. Uber to get downtown.
---

Stayed at the Country Inn and Suites near the Brave's baseball stadium, Turner field. It is close to downtown and about a 5.75 Uber Ride. It's approximately 3 miles and is under 100 per night. I could have booked cheaper but this was a happy medium.

World of Coke - experience. Country coke flavors.
---

On Martin Luther King day I visisted a number of places; starting with the World of Coke. The tour was mostly self serve with a brief video and introduction. The cost was $16. I was solo but being with other visitors made it less lonely. The highlight of this was getting to try Coke flavors from all over the world!
